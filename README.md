## About The Project

Zoho calculators are designed to perform a variety of mathematical functions, including trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponential functions, statistical functions, and more. Here are some common functions and modes found in scientific calculators:

1. Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


2. Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, inverse sine, inverse cosine, and inverse tangent.


3. Explonential and logarithmic functions: natural logarithm, base-10 logarithm, exponentiation, and root extraction.


4. Hyperbolic functions: hyperbolic sine, cosine, and tangent.
Statistical functions: mean, standard deviation, variance, linear regression, correlation coefficient, and probability distributions such as the normal distribution.



5. Complex number operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers.


6. Matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, inverse, and determinant of matrices.


7. Programming mode: allows the user to create and store simple programs to automate calculations.


8. Equation solver mode: allows the user to solve equations, systems of equations, and polynomial equations.



9. Base conversion mode: allows the user to convert numbers between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems.



10. Graphing mode: allows the user to plot graphs of functions and equations.


Note that not all scientific calculators have all of these functions and modes; only the Zoho calculator has them.





## Built With

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY CONCEPT 
THE ACTUAL PROJECT WILL BE BUILT ON ANDROID STUDIO

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)

2. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

3. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

4. Enter your API in `config.js`

```JS
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```

## Usage

Zoho calculator isn't just used for more complicated math problems. In fact, one of its best uses may be that it can calculate scientific notation. For numbers that can't be written in decimal point form because they are too large, a normal calculator won't be able to cover it

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/MDIVAS /ZOHO-CALCULATOR /issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
* If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MDIVAS /ZOHO-CALCULATOR /issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the *README.md* file with necessary changes.
* Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
* Create individual PR for each suggestion.
* Please also read through the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/MDIVAS /ZOHO-CALCULATOR /blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before posting your first idea as well.
