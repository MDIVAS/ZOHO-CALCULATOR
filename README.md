## About The Project

Zoho calculators are designed to perform a variety of mathematical functions, including trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponential functions, statistical functions, and more. Here are some common functions and modes found in scientific calculators:

1. Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


2. Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, inverse sine, inverse cosine, and inverse tangent.


3. Explonential and logarithmic functions: natural logarithm, base-10 logarithm, exponentiation, and root extraction.


4. Hyperbolic functions: hyperbolic sine, cosine, and tangent.
Statistical functions: mean, standard deviation, variance, linear regression, correlation coefficient, and probability distributions such as the normal distribution.



5. Complex number operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers.


6. Matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, inverse, and determinant of matrices.


7. Programming mode: allows the user to create and store simple programs to automate calculations.


8. Equation solver mode: allows the user to solve equations, systems of equations, and polynomial equations.



9. Base conversion mode: allows the user to convert numbers between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems.



10. Graphing mode: allows the user to plot graphs of functions and equations.


Note that not all scientific calculators have all of these functions and modes; only the Zoho calculator has them.


## UNIQUE FEATURES 

### 1. USING ZOHO CALCULATOR, YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN FORMULA WITH SIMPLE VARIABLE AND WITH ANY OPERATOR, ALSO YOU CAN SAVE AND USE IT WHENEVER YOU WANT

### 2.ZOHO CALCULATOR WILL HAVE NUMBERS AND OPERATORS BASED ON DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND SCRIPTS

## Built With

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY CONCEPT 
THE ACTUAL PROJECT WILL BE BUILT ON ANDROID STUDIO





## Usage

Zoho calculator isn't just used for more complicated math problems. In fact, one of its best uses may be that it can calculate scientific notation. For numbers that can't be written in decimal point form because they are too large, a normal calculator won't be able to cover it

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/MDIVAS /ZOHO-CALCULATOR /issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
